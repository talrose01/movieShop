This project was built as helper to the students being developing Node&Angular E-Commerce app.
It is just an example, you can use it and develop your own app on it.
Some of the examples may not follow the true design concepts well.
You need to follow the design concepts that you have learned in class !!!
Any claims regarding possible discrepancies between this helper and your implementation, will not be accepted !!!

Run the project:
    open cmd and navigate to the path folder
    type node aaa.js
    open your browser and type localhost:4000

Good Luck,
Netanel :)
